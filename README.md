## Welcome to the 3co lab!
3co, Inc. is a Techstars-funded company that was founded by [Steven T. Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steventjenkins/), [Robert W. Cohn](https://rwcohn.github.io/homepage/), and [Lance Legel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/legel/).

The company has been researching and developing photonic, robotic, geospatial, and ecophysiological intelligence since 2018.

You're welcome to explore pipelines of our codebase here, and especially recommend looking into our [3D reconstruction code](https://github.com/legel/3co/tree/master/reconstruction).

We also understand you may not be ready to dive into thousands of lines of code (at least not yet -- if ever!).  

Besides the above, here are a few of the major R&D projects from 3co:

### Augmented reality app for home & garden e-commerce of indoor house plants
  - See this very elegant video about 3co made with funding from Royal FloraHolland ([_1_](https://player.vimeo.com/video/262028192?autoplay=1#t=0m59s))
  - And this cool demo video live of product exploration and purchasing in augmented reality ([_2_](https://www.3co.ai/augmented-reality-commerce.mp4))

### Autonomous robotics for photorealistic 3D reconstruction of plants
  - Cool 3D simulations of animated robot design ([_1_](https://www.3co.ai/iris1.mp4), [_2_](https://www.3co.ai/iris_3d.mp4))
  - Live demo of prototype 3D scanning machine ([_3_](https://www.3co.ai/iris_by_3co.mp4)),
  - Provisional patent filing ([_4_](https://www.3co.ai/inverse_rendering_with_3d_coordinate_measuring_machines.pdf)))
