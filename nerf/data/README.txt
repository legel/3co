Download data for full-resolution ("large") and downsampled ("small") iPhone scans of a Turkish pillow, here:

https://x3co.s3.amazonaws.com/pillow_small.tar.gz
https://x3co.s3.amazonaws.com/pillow_large.tar.gz

Download those .tar.gz files into this data folder.
Then unzip them in their own folders:

tar -xf pillow_small.tar.gz
tar -xf pillow_large.tar.gz

Then you can run 'python learn.py' with the chosen dataset identified at the top of that file.
